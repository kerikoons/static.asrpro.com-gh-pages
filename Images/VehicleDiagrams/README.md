NOTE:  This directory contains the view angle images for vehicle diagrams.  In the case of default Diagram Sets, there will be duplicate directories/images:  

- One that in human readable (e.g. Images\VehicleDiagrams\coupe (2)\front.png)
- One that is accessed by the application and associated to the respective default VehicleDiagramSet (e.g. Images\VehicleDiagrams\2\4.png)

Please do not manually delete either of these.
